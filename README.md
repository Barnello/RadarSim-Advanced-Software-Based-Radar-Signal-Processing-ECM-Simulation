# RadarSim-Advanced-Software-Based-Radar-Signal-Processing-ECM-Simulation

**Project Overview:**
Develop a radar signal processing simulator that models radar signal detection, tracking, and electronic countermeasure (ECM) techniques in a purely software-based environment. This project will focus on simulating radar waveforms, detecting target signals amid noise and interference, and applying ECM techniques such as jamming and deception to assess radar resilience.

**Key Features:**

**Radar Signal Generation and Simulation:**
- Develop a signal generator in C++ that can create various radar waveforms (e.g., pulse, FMCW). These signals will represent real-world radar emissions.
- Implement models for radar signal propagation, including effects such as multipath fading, Doppler shift, and range resolution.

**Signal Detection and Tracking:**
- Apply advanced DSP techniques like matched filtering and pulse compression to detect radar returns. Use algorithms such as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) for threshold detection.
- Develop a multi-target tracking system using Kalman filters or particle filters to follow target movements and account for noise and clutter.

**Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Simulation:**
- Simulate various ECM techniques such as noise jamming, deception jamming (false target generation), or frequency hopping to disrupt the radarâ€™s ability to track or detect targets.
- Model the radar's response to ECM and create algorithms to improve radar resilience by adapting its waveform or filtering techniques.

**C++ Optimization for High Performance:**
- Implement multi-threading and parallel processing to ensure real-time simulation performance, especially for large data sets.
- Optimize DSP algorithms in C++ for low-latency processing, focusing on techniques such as loop unrolling, SIMD instructions, and memory management.

**Signal Visualization:**
- Use a C++ visualization library (e.g., SFML, SDL, or Qt) to create graphical displays of the radar signals, detected targets, and ECM effects. This would allow the user to visualize radar behavior and ECM interactions in real time.
